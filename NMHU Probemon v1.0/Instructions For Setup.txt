****NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO BE INSTALLED ON A RASPBERRY PI 3!****

Instructions for setting up the NMHU Probemon File:

First, connect to your local network- this can be done from the desktop via clicking
the upper right corner symbol for network, or from the command line for more experienced users.

Make sure all of your regular pi settings are what you want (example: enabling or disabling SSH)


INSTALLATION STEPS:

Copy the 'Probemon' folder from this directory to the /home/pi directory on your pi (via USB stick or however you want to move it)

Then, once the pi is on the network, go to the command line to enter commands:
(instructions and notes are in parenthesis- don't type these in)

	sudo apt-get update (update for getting upcoming files)

(For the packet sniffer)
	sudo apt-get install tshark (install tshark sniffer)
	sudo apt-get install tcpdump (install/update tcpdump)
	sudo pip install -U pip (upgrade existing pip inclusion)
	sudo pip3 install netaddr (install netaddr)
	sudo pip3 install scapy-python3 (install scapy)

(if using a database)
	sudo python3.4 -m pip install --upgrade pip (update pip)
	sudo python3.4 -m pip install --upgrade wheel setuptools requests (use pip to install libraries)

(setting the program to run automatically using systemd)
	sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/probescript.service (create script file to autorun probemon)
		
	(type the following into the empty screen in console)

		[Unit]
		Description=Probemon Startup Service
		After=multi-user.target

		[Service]
		Type=idle
		ExecStart=/home/pi/Probemon/probescript

		[Install]
		WantedBy=multi-user.target


	(save with CRTL-X, Y, Enter)
	(set user permissions)
	sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/probescript.service
	sudo chmod 755 /home/pi/Probemon/probescript

	(enable service)
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	sudo systemctl enable probescript.service

- optional: set pi to turn itself off every day at a certain time
	(from the command line, open crontab)
	crontab -e
	(in crontab, move cursor to the bottom and enter the following:)
	0 20 * * * sudo poweroff
	(This sets the pi to turn itself off at 8:00 pm every day as a precaution)
	(you can use a different time- just remember it uses 24 hour periods, and the format is:)
	(min hour * * * command)

	(CTRL+X, then Y, then enter to save)
